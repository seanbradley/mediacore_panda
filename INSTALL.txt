Installation of MediaCore Plugins
---------------------------------

Please visit http://mediacore.com/plugins/ for the latest list of MediaCore plugins.

 * Download and extract the plugin:
   You can technically extract a MediaCore plugin to anywhere you like, but we recommend
   placing it at the same level as your Virtual Environment and your main MediaCore installation.

   A common layout would look like this:
     /home/user/mediacore_env > Your MediaCore Virtual Environment
     /home/user/mediacore > The main installation of MediaCore

     In this case, download your desired MediaCore plugin to /home/user and extract it there.
     Your plugin should now be extracted to /home/user/MediaCore-PluginName-0.9x
     We will use this layout as the base for the remaining instructions.

 * Activate your MediaCore virtual environment:
   In order to install your plugin you first need to activate your MediaCore Virtual Environment.
   If you haven't already done so, run the following commands:
     - cd /home/user
     - source mediacore_env/bin/activate

 * Install your plugin!
   With your MediaCore Virtual Environment activated, you can now activate your plugin:
     - cd MediaCore-PluginName-0.9x
     - python setup.py develop

   This will run the setup script for the plugin and install any dependencies for the plugin.
   When this has been successfully completed, your plugin will be active in MediaCore!
